# Linear Scale Grade Service

This is a simple service that provides a RESTful API for managing student grades in a school. The service is built using Python and FastAPI, and it uses a PostgreSQL database to store student, subject, and grade information.


## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ariel1985/linear_scale_grade_sys.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd linear-scale-grade-service
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db/postgres
```

4. Build and start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build

# or use the load balancer acting as linear scale
docker-compose up --scale api=3
```

Note: To sync between the database and API service, the loading time takes about 10 seconds.

5. The service should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

To view the API documentation, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`.


## Linear Scale Grade Service

Load Balancer Acting as Linear Scale
The Nginx load balancer allows horizontal scaling by distributing incoming HTTP requests across multiple instances of the FastAPI application. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Upstream Servers:

The upstream block in the nginx.conf file defines a group of servers (api_servers). Requests to the load balancer are distributed among these servers.
Currently, it points to a single instance (api:8000). For true horizontal scaling, you can deploy multiple instances of the FastAPI application.
Load Balancing:

Nginx balances the incoming traffic across the defined upstream servers. This means if you scale the api service to multiple replicas, Nginx will distribute the traffic among them.


### To use: 

```bash
docker-compose up --scale api=3
```
